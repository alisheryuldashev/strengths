Back in 2016 I took the StrengthsFinder assessment and I loved the results that focused on how important it was to know your strengths to be engaged at work and build a great team of co workers around you. But after a while, I completely forgot about my strenghts and their meaning. 

So, I decided to build this simple webpage to remind myself of what makes me special in a workplace. 

I used html/css/jquery to build this page. 

Simply use your mouse to hover over each title to see more.
