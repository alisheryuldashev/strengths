Discover my top 5 strengths 

Back in 2016 I took the StrengthsFinder assessment and I loved the results that focused on how important it was to know your strengths to be engaged at work and build a great team of co workers around you. But after a while, I completely forgot about my strenghts and their meaning. 

So, I decided to build this simple webpage to remind myself of what makes me special in a workplace. 

This was my first ever independent project in web development. I used html/css/jquery languages to build this and it took me 2 full days to complete this page. 

Simply use your mouse to hover over each title to see more.
